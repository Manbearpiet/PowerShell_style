# PowerShell_style

In this repository I want to train my ScriptAnalyzer and Pester skills by creating a repository that supports several recommendations from:
- The [PowerShell Practice and Style - gitbook](https://poshcode.gitbook.io/powershell-practice-and-style/style-guide/code-layout-and-formatting).
- The Microsoft Docs about PowerShell

The repository is divided up in the recommendations of each seperate repository.
You can test these with PSScriptAnalyzer:
```powershell
 Find-PSResource PSScriptAnalyzer | Install-PSResource
```
